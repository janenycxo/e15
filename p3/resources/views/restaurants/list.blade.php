<strong>Review:</strong> The items were built beautifully, and despite being a French cuisine...their portions are generous and filling. The strawberries and bananas were plentiful and the sud ouest had plenty of slices of cheese melted to a gooey consistency and perfectly peeked out of the dark crepe envelope.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> The branzino was beautifully de-boned and had a slight crisp outer texture. It was a large fish for a table of 2. While the shrimp santorini came on a sizzling platter, i am fortunate it settled by the time it reached our table so it wouldn't splatter stains. The broccoli rabe had a little too much feta going on, but still the meal was so delicious!
