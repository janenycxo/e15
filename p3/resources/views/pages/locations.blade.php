<strong>Description:</strong> The place is small and a bit hard to navigate but it gave off a rustic and cozy backyard sort of comfort.<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> The food is delicious, the ambiance and appeal are comforting, but I truly believe the service adds to the magic. Look the bottom line is that there is something special about the Alcove and since we were in a rush I really could not pinpoint what it was.<br>

<strong>Restaurant Link:</strong> https://www.yelp.com/biz/toms-brooklyn?osq=toms<br>
<strong>Description:</strong> A good classic neighborhood dinner with excellent breakfast staples. Eggs, omelettes, pancakes, waffles. All the basics done well with no fuss. Plates start at around $10 and the portions are huge. Pastrami with eggs easily had 1/3 lb of pastrami.<br>
<strong>Review:</strong> An old school place.  A diner without the diner like feel, you know what I mean.  Came in here on a whim for a weekday brunch.  Glad we did.  Its a pretty straight forward joint.  It gets to be busy between delivery, takeout  and dine-in.  Juggling all that, they do just fine, Imo.  Being around the block for awhile now, I expect that from them.<br>

The strawberries and bananas were plentiful and the sud ouest had plenty of slices of cheese melted to a gooey consistency and perfectly peeked out of the dark crepe envelope.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> When you sit down you are given fresh parmesan blocks off of a giant wheel, the most delicious olives, warm bread and butter. Dip your bread in the oil from olives. I wanted to drink it. And they will bring you more bread w/o an extra charge. You will need it to sop up the tasty sauces and things.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> The food was solid and it has a straightforward interior.  Is a 5 star a stretch a little? Maybe. I have it in the 4 star range but I can definitely see why people love it.  I will definitely be back.<br>

<strong>Review:</strong> Now the German Chocolate Cake - this cake is insane. Seriously, it was some of the most overwhelming, rich, dense cake I have ever had, and I mean all those adjectives in the most complimentary way possible. It was really one of the most satisfying slices of cake I ever had, but it left me feeling pretty destroyed.<br>
